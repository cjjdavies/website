    "text": "Link to dashboard on GitHub\nThe aim of this dashboard project is to summarise the impact of deprivation on psychiatric patient hospitalizations across Scotland, using discharge data from the Scottish Public Health Observatory for the most recent period for which data are available: 2017-18 to 2019-20. The main outputs are a map and summary statistics to compare between the most deprived and least deprived areas across each of Scotland’s local authorities and health boards.\nTo produce the map, I used data of psychiatric patient hospitalization discharges from each council area in Scotland, including quintile data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. These data can be downloaded from the Scottish Public Health Observatory 2021. Also necessary is a quality shapefile of Scotland, coded to include geometry linked to council area, available from https://www.spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home.\n\n\nDefinition: Patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals: 3-year rolling average number and directly age-sex standardised rate per 100,000 population. All rates have been standardised against the European standard population(ESP2013) and 2011-base population estimates. Patient is selected only once per year, based on their discharge date. Values less than 10 are suppressed. No rounding. All age-groups and sexes.\nData Source: Public Health Scotland (SMR04)\nGeography code: A standard code assigned to geographical areas, which in this case is council area\nNumerator: Number of patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals; denominator: total population\nIndicator-measure: Age-sex standardised rate per 100,000\nQuintile: Based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), five categories of deprivation are used from 1 - most deprived (the 20% most deprived) to 5 - least deprived (the 20% least deprived). All other variables are aligned to these data, where applicable, specifically, geography code, numerator, indicator, and confidence intervals\nPeriod: financial year from 2002/03-2019/20, 3-year aggregates\nConfidence interval: Dobson’s method\n\n\n\nWhen working on building these types of projects, I follow a file structure recommended in this r-bloggers post by Martin Chan, and shown in the image below.\n\n\n\nDiagram of R project file structure\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to acquire the data from the Scottish Public Health Observatory as .csv files which are downloaded into pph_csv_files folders. I moved all separate files into a /data/pph_csv_files folder to keep them in one place. All time periods for all areas were initially chosen to ensure there would be sufficient data of an appropriate quality to be able to generate an interesting map.\n\nCreate a collection of .csv files saved into the current directory, first by defining the working directory where the csv files are located.\n\n\nmydir = \"../../data/pph_csv_files/\"\n\n\nThen specify the filepath and filetypes to search for, and include the full file names in the object\n\n\nmyfiles = list.files(path = mydir, pattern = \"*.csv\", full.names = TRUE)\n\n\nInspect the object and check there are the correct number of files listed as the ones downloaded. You should also be able to see the number of files listed in the environment pane.\n\n\nmyfiles\n\n\n\n\nThe R Studio ‘Environment’ tab showing ‘myfiles’ with 32 files listed\n\n\n\nLoad the plyr and readr packages. Use the ldply function from the plyr package and ’read_csv from the readr package to join all .csv files into one. The show_col_types = FALSE argument suppresses the output in the terminal.\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nall_data = ldply(myfiles, readr::read_csv, show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\nView the first five rows and columns 2-5 of the data.\n\n\nall_data[1:5, 2:5]\n\n  geography_code           quintile\n1      S12000033  1 - most deprived\n2      S12000033                  2\n3      S12000033                  3\n4      S12000033                  4\n5      S12000033 5 - least deprived\n                                                 period numerator\n1 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates     212.7\n2 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates     173.0\n3 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates     169.3\n4 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates      82.3\n5 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates      76.7\n\n\n\nCreate a tibble of the files.\n\n\nall_data <- tibble::as_tibble(all_data)\n\n\nA sample of the dataset is shown here to demonstrate the main columns to be used in this project.

The histogram below illustrates this concept.\nThere are notably large differences between 3rd quartiles and max values, indicating presence of outlying values.\n\n\nhist(all_data_subset$indicator_measure)\n\n\n\n\nHowever these measures are based on the whole dataset all_data_subset, and have not been filtered by time period or geographical location. I need to dig deeper into the data to identify possible temporal or spatial trends that may be worth further investigation."

Including error bars, for standard error, standard deviation or confidence interval (depending on your analysis), can be helpful in determining whether differences observed between categories may be significant or not. This is relatively easy to do with R.\nI will follow these steps to produce a barchart with confidence interval bars for the most deprived and least deprived for each local authority in Scotland.\n\nFilter the quintiles of interest from the subsetted dataframe, all_data_subset.\nSet the aesthetics (known as aes in ggplot), using period for the x axis and indicator_measure for the y axis. The fill argument is used to define custom colours as used for the boxplots.\nThe geom_bar function specifies a barchart, requiring additional arguments to create groups based on the two quintile categories and clustered according to time period. The width of the bar needs to be specified here, using the same width for the errorbars in order to ensure they are centred properly in the barchart.\nThe errorbars are specified from the data - lower_confidence_interval and upper_confidence_interval and positioned correctly using the position = position_dodge argument.\nThe barplots are separated into local authority based on geography_code - these are an important part of mapping and will be discussed further in the mapping section.\n\n\npsych_barplot <- all_data_subset %>% \n  filter(quintile %in% c(\"1 - most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\")) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = indicator_measure, fill = quintile)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n           position = \"dodge\",\n           width = 0.8) + # Specifying the bar width here will make it easier to centre error bars\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_confidence_interval,\n                    ymax = upper_confidence_interval),\n                width = 0.4,\n                position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) + # Use the 'width' argument to centre error bars\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Psychiatric Patient Hospitalisations from most deprived\\nand least deprived areas of Scotland, 2002 to 2020\",\n       subtitle = \"Age-standardised rate per 100,000\",\n       caption = \"Source: Scottish Public Health Observatory 2021\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(.~geography_code, ncol = 4) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), # Removes heavy background formatting\n        panel.border = element_blank(), # Removes the outline border around the plot\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"), # Changes the background fill from the plot titles (\"1 most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\") from gray to colour of choice\n        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10), # Changes text size of plot titles (\"1 most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\")\n        legend.position = \"none\", # Removes the legend\n        plot.title = element_text(vjust = 1, lineheight = 1.15), # Moves the vertical alignment of the plot title and increases the spacing between the title lines\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, vjust = 1, lineheight = 1.5), # Modifies the features of the subtitle: text size, vertical adjustment and lineheight\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, vjust = -1, hjust = 0), # Modifies the caption attributes, including horizontal adjustment\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(), # Removes the x axis title\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(), # Removes the y axis title\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\", angle = 90), # Modifies the x axis text\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\")) # Modifies the y axis text\n\npsych_barplot\n\n\n\n\nBy calling the ggplot object, psych_boxplot, you can see your graphic nicely rendered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nFor age-standardised rate per 100,000 population, there is a higher proportion of discharges from psychiatric hospitals for people from most deprived areas than least deprived areas.

The faceting has separated the barplots by geography code, which has been used to label each plot.

    "text": "This post is more of a reminder to me on how to work with Python from VS Code. As I intend to improve my Python skills and combine other languages (such as R, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, bash) I have been looking into different development environments that would enable me to switch easily between them.\nIt is easy to forget how to make this work, so I have created a short summary of the steps I took to get started.\n\n\nI work with Ubuntu 22.10. I have been using Ubuntu for many years, since the days of Feisty Fawn (2007-ish), which coincided with starting a PhD at the University of Edinburgh. I figured it would be important to learn coding, and I have been fascinated with computing from a young age, though I didn’t get my first Windows PC until I was in my mid-20s. I DID have a Nintendo 8-bit as a kid and played it until my fingers bled (to steal a quote from Bryan Adams). I also started learning R around 2007 as I was not counting on an academic career, even though I wanted one, and therefore no guarantee I would be able to access expensive statistical software.\nI took a couple of Unix courses with the University and learned to work with the command line and bash for general system administration.\n\n\n\nPython 3 comes integrated with newer versions of Ubuntu; Python 2 is no longer supported.\nVirtual environments are very handy for projects that use various packages that may be updated over time. Package developers and maintainers sometimes need to change functions and deprecate certain features, which means projects and programs created with deprecated functions may break when packages are upgraded. By creating projects in virtual environments with the packages installed in those environments, the programs should run as expected.\nFor a long time R has not used this approach, so there have been many times when I have upgraded packages to find my code will not run and I had to figure out what has changed and how to fix it. Bit of a faff, but I like to keep things up to date. Fortunately R is now starting to use virtual environments, and with the rise in the use of containerised environments, the issues of package changes are becoming a bit easier to deal with.\nThe excellent folks at FreeCodeCamp wrote a very helpful tutorial on getting started with virtual environments for Python 3, which can be found here: How to Set Up Virtualenv with Virtualenvwrapper on Ubuntu 18.04. The author is Goran Aviani.\nEven though it is written for an earlier version of Ubuntu, it still works for the version I use.\nI first navigate to the .virtualenvs directory using the following code:\ncd .virtualenvs\nThen create a new virtual space:\nmkvirtualenv new_project\nThe output might look like this, depending on your setup:\ncreated virtual environment CPython3.10.7.final.0-64 in 106ms\n  creator CPython3Posix(dest=/your_system/your_directory/.virtualenvs/new_project, clear=False, no_vcs_ignore=False, global=False)\n  seeder FromAppData(download=False, pip=bundle, setuptools=bundle, wheel=bundle, via=copy, app_data_dir=/your_system/your_directory/.local/share/virtualenv)\n    added seed packages: pip==22.3.1, setuptools==65.5.1, wheel==0.38.4\n  activators BashActivator,CShellActivator,FishActivator,NushellActivator,PowerShellActivator,PythonActivator\nvirtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /your_system/your_directory/.virtualenvs/new_project/bin/predeactivate\nvirtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /your_system/your_directory/.virtualenvs/new_project/bin/postdeactivate\nvirtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /your_system/your_directory/.virtualenvs/new_project/bin/preactivate\nvirtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /your_system/your_directory/.virtualenvs/new_project/bin/postactivate\nvirtualenvwrapper.user_scripts creating /your_system/your_directory/.virtualenvs/new_project/bin/get_env_details\n\n\n\nAfter trying various IDEs, I have opted for VS Code as it was recommended for its accessibility. There are others I tried that I liked, but I felt I needed to just crack on with something and VS Code is it.\nI installed VS Code using the instructions from the page Visual Studio Code on Linux, which worked as expected. Then I followed the tutorial Python in Visual Studio Code to install the Python extension.\nIn order to run VS Code so that it links to the correct virtual environment for the project I want to work in, I use the Ubuntu terminal to navigate to the new project folder in the virtual environment I just created contained with the .virtualenvs directory.\ncd .virtualenvs/new_project\nThen I start VS Code within that folder with:\ncode .\nThis should initialise the virtual environment and create the necessary files, such as config files, .gitignore, and various dependencies and other packages that might be installed along the way."

    "text": "It happened by accident.\nI had planned to do A-Levels once I finished school: Art, English Literature and Design (or something like that). Despite very early aspirations to be an astronomer and travel to space, I ended up at a bad secondary school and mostly stopped attending by third year onwards because I was very bored, and the behaviour of the other kids was how I imagine a juvenile detention facility might be. Teachers lacked the crowd control skills needed to create a learning environment, but in their defence, riot police might have struggled.\nThere was no encouragement from home to continue learning, and we needed money, so just after I turned 16 I got a job as a Tailoring Alterations Hand at a menswear company (this is not on my CV). I quickly became bored (again) and wanted to learn things, but had never really had any direction from anyone who might know better.\nA chance meeting with someone I knew from school suggested studying horticulture as she had recently done and I thought ‘why not’?\nThe nearest agricultural college, Broomfield, as it was called back then, held an open day that I attended.\nWith my GCSE certificate in a file to show them, they urged me to consider the BTEC National Diploma in Horticulture - the equivalent of two A-levels. At that time it was a 3-year course: years 1 and 3 at college, and the second year on an industrial work placement. I knew nothing about plants and remember working so hard.\nFor the first term I felt very lost, except for plant identification tests. Somehow I just seemed to easily absorb botanical names, including families, and averaged 100% at the end of the course.\nThe following term I continued to work hard to catch up with everyone else on the course, which seemed to pay off with the sheer volume of knowledge I was developing. I really enjoyed it - the science, physical work, technical aspects and design. It had everything I needed.\nFor my work placement I chose James Coles Nursery in Leicester, where I spent a year in the propagation department taking cuttings and learning how to produce hardy ornamental nursery stock. When I started, I really wanted to work in a nursery and someday run my own. By the time I finished my placement I had endured so much bullying from the Head of Propagation that I decided I never wanted to step foot in a commercial nursery again. My college did nothing to support me and the nursery management never took any action, despite repeated complaints from various other staff in that department.\nI did eventually return to commercial nursery work, taking seasonal employment with Johnsons of Whixley during my HND in Horticulture with Plantsmanship with the Scottish Agricultural College and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. Johnsons was the opposite of Coles and I found myself really enjoying it. They seemed to like my work ethic and asked if I would return at the end of HND, but I already had aspirations to do a degree and they said they tended to not hire people with degrees.\nBetween the BTEC and the HND I worked at the Jerusalem Botanic Garden in Israel for a year, and upon my return to the UK took up employment as a sole gardener on a private estate in Cheshire. Stories I will save for another time though."

    "text": "The opportunity to spend a year at the Jerusalem Botanic Garden in Israel came about by accident: I saw a leaflet in the college library advertising scholarship opportunities for horticulturists and botanists. I never expected to be offered a place, and there was intense disapproval from home quarters that meant I was unable to celebrate what felt like a massive victory for me.\nLeaving the UK was something I was very keen to do. Perhaps it was the place where I grew up, and my own circumstances, but there had been a strong lack of feeling of belonging. Combined with few opportunities to improve my life where I was, I knew I needed to get out.\nHorticulture has always done that for me - provided an escape either physically, mentally, and often both together.\nI settled in pretty quickly and the placement got off to a good start. We were provided a flat near to the botanical garden, which itself was next to a small supermarket. There were two other people coming to the end of their scholarship terms, and I was initially sharing with them, a gardener from Waddesdon Manor, and a tree surgeon who was starting his scholarship at the same time as me, but for a period of 6 months; I opted for 12 months. A third person was due to arrive shortly after, although he was eventually escorted back to the UK by his parents. It seems he had some type of mental illness which was deteriorating.\nThe tree surgeon left after about a month when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant.\nAfter that, it was me, the gardener from Waddesdon, and a very pleasant French man who was doing a bit of travelling and volunteering.\nBy Christmas I was alone in the flat. The garden staff were not particularly sociable, and my line manager was a Jekyll and Hyde type of person. My neighbours were very good and kind; they shared a lot of hospitality and knowledge of Judaism and Jewish culture, inviting me to their garden area for feasts and festival celebrations - pretty much most of October that year was spent at their place listening to Jewish songs and stories.\nAn elderly couple who lived in the flat next to mine on the top floor had survived Auschwitz. The man played the violin and would often apologise for the ‘noise’, but it was such a beautiful sound to hear that I would ask him to play as much and as often as he wanted.\nIt was a turbulent year to be there. The man who ran the botanical garden sacked everyone with any botanical or horticultural qualifications, retaining various people from his moshav to work. The head of the outdoor team, who was a really nice guy but had no idea how to manage a garden, cut down a beautiful Paulownia tomentosa and drilled a hole down the centre of the heartwood.\nThere were only two scholarship recipients by that time; we couldn’t be sacked because we technically weren’t employed there. Over a period of about three months we kept things ticking over as best we could, along with the Palestinian labourers who did most of the hard landscaping and cleaning. We put in some extremely long days, working far more than we were supposed to. It was very disappointing when the staff came back and we requested time off that we were told we could not take any, and would not be getting any additional time in lieu that had accrued. The same people who had been given the boot at a moment’s notice, and whose jobs we were covering, were now telling us to “move on” and “that’s all in the past”.\nI went to Egypt for a couple of weeks and took my final month at the garden as holiday. There was no farewell or thank you from anyone. The whole situation overshadowed the experience of living in a different country, learning about the native flora and contributing to an interesting and important project. At the time it was the only botanical garden in the Middle East, but due to political tensions, only Israelis and occasionally Palestinians could visit. Citizens of most other countries outside the Middle East could spend time there.\nIn the end I was glad to leave. I was tired of the hostility and resentment from other garden staff, the blatant sexism from senior men at the garden, and the perpetual sexual harassment I received every time I ventured outside my flat. My pale skin and blue eyes attracted a lot of attention, which was incredibly jarring, more so because I was teased at school for being so pale. It was entirely unexpected and I was utterly unprepared to deal with the very poor attitude to women. It didn’t make a difference whether the man was Israeli or Arab, religious or secular, young or old. I was seen as an exploitable resource and it changed me in ways I still carry with me.\nMy next post about my time in Israel will focus more on the plants and my travels."

    "text": "The opportunity to spend a year at the Jerusalem Botanic Garden in Israel came about by accident: I saw a leaflet in the college library advertising scholarship opportunities for horticulturists and botanists. I never expected to be offered a place, and there was intense disapproval from home quarters that meant I was unable to celebrate what felt like a massive victory for me.\nLeaving the UK was something I was very keen to do. Perhaps it was the place where I grew up, and my own circumstances, but there had been a strong lack of feeling of belonging. Combined with few opportunities to improve my life where I was, I knew I needed to get out.\nHorticulture has always done that for me - provided an escape either physically, mentally, and often both together.\nI settled in pretty quickly and the placement got off to a good start. We were provided a flat near to the botanical garden, which itself was next to a small supermarket. There were two other people coming to the end of their scholarship terms, and I was initially sharing with them, a gardener from Waddesdon Manor, and a tree surgeon who was starting his scholarship at the same time as me, but for a period of 6 months; I opted for 12 months. A third person was due to arrive shortly after, although he was eventually escorted back to the UK by his parents. It seems he had some type of mental illness which was deteriorating.\nThe tree surgeon left after about a month when he found out his girlfriend was pregnant.\nAfter that, it was me, the gardener from Waddesdon, and a very pleasant French man who was doing a bit of travelling and volunteering.\nBy Christmas I was alone in the flat. The garden staff were not particularly sociable, and my line manager was a Jekyll and Hyde type of person. My neighbours were very good and kind; they shared a lot of hospitality and knowledge of Judaism and Jewish culture, inviting me to their garden area for feasts and festival celebrations - pretty much most of October that year was spent at their place listening to Jewish songs and stories.\nAn elderly couple who lived in the flat next to mine on the top floor had survived Auschwitz. The man played the violin and would often apologise for the ‘noise’, but it was such a beautiful sound to hear that I would ask him to play as much and as often as he wanted.\nIt was a turbulent year to be there. The man who ran the botanical garden sacked everyone with any botanical or horticultural qualifications, retaining various people from his moshav to work. The head of the outdoor team, who was a really nice guy but had no idea how to manage a garden, cut down a beautiful Paulownia tomentosa and drilled a hole down the centre of the heartwood.\nThere were only two scholarship recipients by that time; we couldn’t be sacked because we technically weren’t employed there. Over a period of about three months we kept things ticking over as best we could, along with the Palestinian labourers who did most of the hard landscaping and cleaning. We put in some extremely long days, working far more than we were supposed to. It was very disappointing when the staff came back and we requested time off that we were told we could not take any, and would not be getting any additional time in lieu that had accrued. The same people who had been given the boot at a moment’s notice, and whose jobs we were covering, were now telling us to “move on” and “that’s all in the past”.\nI went to Egypt for a couple of weeks and took my final month at the garden as holiday. There was no farewell or thank you from anyone. The whole situation overshadowed the experience of living in a different country, learning about the native flora and contributing to an interesting and important project. At the time it was the only botanical garden in the Middle East, but due to political tensions, only Israelis and occasionally Palestinians could visit. Citizens of most other countries outside the Middle East could spend time there.\nIn the end I was glad to leave. I was tired of the hostility and resentment from other garden staff, the blatant sexism from senior men at the garden, and the perpetual sexual harassment I received every time I ventured outside my flat. My pale skin and blue eyes attracted a lot of attention, which was incredibly jarring, more so because I was teased at school for being so pale. It was entirely unexpected and I was utterly unprepared to deal with the very poor attitude to women. It didn’t make a difference whether the man was Israeli or Arab, religious or secular, young or old. I was seen as an exploitable resource and it changed me in ways I still carry with me.\nMy next post about my time in Israel will focus more on the plants and my travels."
