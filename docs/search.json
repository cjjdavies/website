If you like what you see and are interested in collaborations or hiring me, do contact me.\n\n\nThe name ‘Growing Research’ used to be a limited company I owned, which was a consultancy providing research, grant-writing and training services for the land-based sector. Although the company currently does not exist, I like the name and decided to continue using it.\n\n\nAll of the beautiful illustrations on this site are Scottish aspen, Populus tremula, drawn by Scotland-based artist Linda Russell"

Values less than 10 are suppressed. No rounding. All age-groups and sexes.\nData Source: Public Health Scotland (SMR04)\nGeography code: A standard code assigned to geographical areas, which in this case is council area\nNumerator: Number of patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals; denominator: total population\nIndicator-measure: Age-sex standardised rate per 100,000\nQuintile: Based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), five categories of deprivation are used from 1 - most deprived (the 20% most deprived) to 5 - least deprived (the 20% least deprived). All other variables are aligned to these data, where applicable, specifically, geography code, numerator, indicator, and confidence intervals\nPeriod: financial year from 2002/03-2019/20, 3-year aggregates\nConfidence interval: Dobson’s method\nData were collected from https://scotland.shinyapps.io/ScotPHO_profiles_tool/, using the ‘Inequalities’ tab and selecting across all council areas and time periods."

These data can be downloaded from the Scottish Public Health Observatory 2021. Also necessary is a quality shapefile of Scotland coded to include geometry linked to council area, available from https://www.spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home.\n\nRead in .csv files and join together\nThe first step is to acquire the data from the Scottish Public Health Observatory as .csv files (contained within the pph_csv_files folder). All time periods for all areas were initially chosen to ensure there would be sufficient data of an appropriate quality to be able to generate an interesting map.\n\n# Create a collection of .csv files saved into the current directory, first by defining the working directory where the csv files are located.\nmydir = \"~/Documents/psych_hospital/pph_csv_files\"\n\n# Then specify the filepath and filetypes to search for, and include the full file names in the object\nmyfiles = list.files(path = mydir, pattern = \"*.csv\", full.names = TRUE)\n\n# Inspect the object - there should be 32 files\nmyfiles\n\n# Join the files using ldply from the plyr package\nall_data = plyr::ldply(myfiles, readr::read_csv)\n\n# View the first 10 rows of data within the RMarkdown window below\nall_data\n\n# Create a tibble of the files by combining all files into one using column headers to join the data\nall_data <- tibble::as_tibble(all_data)\n\n# Save the tibble as a data file readable by R\nsave(all_data, file = \"all_data.rda\")\n\n# Make a backup file from the amalgamated .csv files as one .csv\nreadr::write_excel_csv(all_data, \"all_data.csv\")\n\n\n\nData cleaning: checking data quality and preparing for analysis\nBefore thinking of analysis, I like to carry out various checks to make sure the data object(s) is (are) of the type I need and coded appropriately, for example, categories are factors, numeric and integer data are recognised as such.\nThe data in the ‘period’ column needs to be from the current text of “yyyy/yy to yyyy/yy financial years; 3-year aggregates” to “yyyy-yy to yyyy-yy”."
