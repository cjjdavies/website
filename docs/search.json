    "text": "Link to dashboard on GitHub\nThe aim of this dashboard project is to summarise the impact of deprivation on psychiatric patient hospitalizations across Scotland, using discharge data from the Scottish Public Health Observatory for the most recent period for which data are available: 2017-18 to 2019-20. The main outputs are a map and summary statistics to compare between the most deprived and least deprived areas across each of Scotland’s local authorities and health boards.\nTo produce the map, I used data of psychiatric patient hospitalization discharges from each council area in Scotland, including quintile data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. These data can be downloaded from the Scottish Public Health Observatory 2021. Also necessary is a quality shapefile of Scotland, coded to include geometry linked to council area, available from https://www.spatialdata.gov.scot/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home.\n\n\nDefinition: Patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals: 3-year rolling average number and directly age-sex standardised rate per 100,000 population. All rates have been standardised against the European standard population(ESP2013) and 2011-base population estimates. Patient is selected only once per year, based on their discharge date. Values less than 10 are suppressed. No rounding. All age-groups and sexes.\nData Source: Public Health Scotland (SMR04)\nGeography code: A standard code assigned to geographical areas, which in this case is council area\nNumerator: Number of patients discharged from psychiatric hospitals; denominator: total population\nIndicator-measure: Age-sex standardised rate per 100,000\nQuintile: Based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD), five categories of deprivation are used from 1 - most deprived (the 20% most deprived) to 5 - least deprived (the 20% least deprived). All other variables are aligned to these data, where applicable, specifically, geography code, numerator, indicator, and confidence intervals\nPeriod: financial year from 2002/03-2019/20, 3-year aggregates\nConfidence interval: Dobson’s method\n\n\n\nWhen working on building these types of projects, I follow a file structure recommended in this r-bloggers post by Martin Chan, and shown in the image below.\n\n\n\nDiagram of R project file structure\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step is to acquire the data from the Scottish Public Health Observatory as .csv files which are downloaded into pph_csv_files folders. I moved all separate files into a /data/pph_csv_files folder to keep them in one place. All time periods for all areas were initially chosen to ensure there would be sufficient data of an appropriate quality to be able to generate an interesting map.\n\nCreate a collection of .csv files saved into the current directory, first by defining the working directory where the csv files are located.\n\n\nmydir = \"../../data/pph_csv_files/\"\n\n\nThen specify the filepath and filetypes to search for, and include the full file names in the object\n\n\nmyfiles = list.files(path = mydir, pattern = \"*.csv\", full.names = TRUE)\n\n\nInspect the object and check there are the correct number of files listed as the ones downloaded. You should also be able to see the number of files listed in the environment pane.\n\n\nmyfiles\n\n\n\n\nThe R Studio ‘Environment’ tab showing ‘myfiles’ with 32 files listed\n\n\n\nLoad the plyr and readr packages. Use the ldply function from the plyr package and ’read_csv from the readr package to join all .csv files into one. The show_col_types = FALSE argument suppresses the output in the terminal.\n\n\nlibrary(plyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\nall_data = ldply(myfiles, readr::read_csv, show_col_types = FALSE)\n\n\nView the first five rows and columns 2-5 of the data.\n\n\nall_data[1:5, 2:5]\n\n  geography_code           quintile\n1      S12000033  1 - most deprived\n2      S12000033                  2\n3      S12000033                  3\n4      S12000033                  4\n5      S12000033 5 - least deprived\n                                                 period numerator\n1 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates     212.7\n2 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates     173.0\n3 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates     169.3\n4 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates      82.3\n5 2002/03 to 2004/05 financial years; 3-year aggregates      76.7\n\n\n\nCreate a tibble of the files.\n\n\nall_data <- tibble::as_tibble(all_data)\n\n\nA sample of the dataset is shown here to demonstrate the main columns to be used in this project.

without the additional text, then replace the forward slash (/) with a hyphen (-).

The histogram below illustrates this concept.\nThere are notably large differences between 3rd quartiles and max values, indicating presence of outlying values.\n\n\nhist(all_data_subset$indicator_measure)\n\n\n\n\nHowever these measures are based on the whole dataset all_data_subset, and have not been filtered by time period or geographical location. I need to dig deeper into the data to identify possible temporal or spatial trends that may be worth further investigation."

    "text": "Boxplots\nThe first set of visuals are boxplots. These types of plots are useful for checking the range and spread of a dataset as they show the summary statistics generated earlier in visual form. They are also useful for identifying distribution, skewness and outliers - all of which can influence the robustness and reliability of statistical models.\nAs I am interested in identifying variation in psychiatric patient hospitalisations attributable to deprivation, I will visualise a subset of data from quintiles 1 (most deprived) and 5 (least deprived), across all time periods.\nI use the following steps:\n\nCall ggplot from package ggplot2 and create a subset of data from the quintiles.\nSpecify the levels within the quintile column with quintile %in% c(“1 - most deprived”, “5 - least deprived”).\nCall the aesthetics to plot time period on the x axis and indicator_measure on the y axis. Boxplots are colour-coded by quintile (using the viridis palette).\ngeom_boxplot(width = 0.5) alters the width of each boxplot to improve fit on the page.\nLabels are added with labs, where title, subtitle and caption can be specified.\nThe viridis palette is used to fill the boxplots with colourblind safe colours.\nThe two groups of boxplots are placed side by side using facet_wrap based on quintile order.\nAdditional aesthetics are managed by the theme_bw and theme() functions.\ntheme_bw creates a simple theme with limited formatting; it is important to use theme() for adjusting other elements of formatting as it has greater flexibility than theme_bw.\n\n\npsych_boxplot <- ggplot(subset(all_data_subset, \n              quintile %in% c(\"1 - most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\")), \n       aes(x = period, y = indicator_measure, fill = quintile)) + \n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Psychiatric Patient Hospitalisations from most deprived\\nand least deprived areas of Scotland, 2002 to 2020\",\n       subtitle = \"Age-standardised rate per 100,000\",\n       caption = \"Source: Scottish Public Health Observatory 2021\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(quintile~.) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), # Removes heavy background formatting\n        panel.border = element_blank(), # Removes the outline border around the plot\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"), # Changes the background fill from the plot titles (\"1 most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\") from gray to colour of choice\n        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12), # Changes text size of plot titles (\"1 most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\")\n        legend.position = \"none\", # Removes the legend\n        plot.title = element_text(vjust = 1, lineheight = 1.15), # Moves the vertical alignment of the plot title and increases the spacing between the title lines\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, vjust = 1, lineheight = 1.5), # Modifies the features of the subtitle: text size, vertical adjustment and lineheight\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, vjust = -1, hjust = 0), # Modifies the caption attributes, including horizontal adjustment\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(), # Removes the x axis title\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(), # Removes the y axis title\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\", angle = 90), # Modifies the x axis text\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\")) # Modifies the y axis text\n\nBy calling the ggplot object, psych_boxplot, you can see your graphic nicely rendered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nFor age-standardised rate per 100,000 population, there is a higher proportion of discharges from psychiatric hospitals for people from most deprived areas than least deprived areas. From 2002 to 2011 the boxplots of most deprived data show a greater spread of datapoints, with more extreme outliers, than the boxplots for least deprived areas. There has been an overall decline in the rate of hospitalisations since the first set of aggregated data were released covering 2003-04 to 2005-06 until the final period of 2017-18 to 2019-2020."

    "text": "Barplot\nBarplots are useful to compare differences between categories. Including error bars, for standard error, standard deviation or confidence interval (depending on your analysis), can be helpful in determining whether differences observed between categories may be significant or not. This is relatively easy to do with R.\nI will follow these steps to produce a barchart with confidence interval bars for the most deprived and least deprived for each local authority in Scotland.\n\nFilter the quintiles of interest from the subsetted dataframe, all_data_subset.\nSet the aesthetics (known as aes in ggplot), using period for the x axis and indicator_measure for the y axis. The fill argument is used to define custom colours as used for the boxplots.\nThe geom_bar function specifies a barchart, requiring additional arguments to create groups based on the two quintile categories and clustered according to time period. The width of the bar needs to be specified here, using the same width for the errorbars in order to ensure they are centred properly in the barchart.\nThe errorbars are specified from the data - lower_confidence_interval and upper_confidence_interval and positioned correctly using the position = position_dodge argument.\nThe barplots are separated into local authority based on geography_code - these are an important part of mapping and will be discussed further in the mapping section.\n\n\npsych_barplot <- all_data_subset %>% \n  filter(quintile %in% c(\"1 - most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\")) %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = period, y = indicator_measure, fill = quintile)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n           position = \"dodge\",\n           width = 0.8) + # Specifying the bar width here will make it easier to centre error bars\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower_confidence_interval,\n                    ymax = upper_confidence_interval),\n                width = 0.4,\n                position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) + # Use the 'width' argument to centre error bars\n  labs(title = \"Comparison of Psychiatric Patient Hospitalisations from most deprived\\nand least deprived areas of Scotland, 2002 to 2020\",\n       subtitle = \"Age-standardised rate per 100,000\",\n       caption = \"Source: Scottish Public Health Observatory 2021\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(alpha = 0.5) +\n  facet_wrap(.~geography_code, ncol = 4) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(panel.background = element_blank(), # Removes heavy background formatting\n        panel.border = element_blank(), # Removes the outline border around the plot\n        strip.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"), # Changes the background fill from the plot titles (\"1 most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\") from gray to colour of choice\n        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10), # Changes text size of plot titles (\"1 most deprived\", \"5 - least deprived\")\n        legend.position = \"none\", # Removes the legend\n        plot.title = element_text(vjust = 1, lineheight = 1.15), # Moves the vertical alignment of the plot title and increases the spacing between the title lines\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, vjust = 1, lineheight = 1.5), # Modifies the features of the subtitle: text size, vertical adjustment and lineheight\n        plot.caption = element_text(size = 10, vjust = -1, hjust = 0), # Modifies the caption attributes, including horizontal adjustment\n        axis.title.x = element_blank(), # Removes the x axis title\n        axis.title.y = element_blank(), # Removes the y axis title\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\", angle = 90), # Modifies the x axis text\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, color = \"black\")) # Modifies the y axis text\n\nBy calling the ggplot object, psych_boxplot, you can see your graphic nicely rendered:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nFor age-standardised rate per 100,000 population, there is a higher proportion of discharges from psychiatric hospitals for people from most deprived areas than least deprived areas.

The faceting has separated the barplots by geography code, which has been used to label each plot. It is possible to see that some geographical areas have greater differences in the number of discharges between the most and least deprived areas, with confidence intervals that do not overlap; for a few areas the differences are not so great.\nThese data are summarised in a table below.\n\nall_data_subset$geography_code <- as.factor(all_data_subset$geography_code)\n\n# dplyr::select(all_data, \"geography_code\") %>% \n#   unique() %>% \n#   kableExtra::kbl() %>% \n#   kable_material(c(\"striped\", \"hover\")) %>% \n#   pack_rows(\"Group 1\", 2, 3, 10, 12, 16, 20) %>% \n#   pack_rows(\"Group 2\", 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32)"
