<!-- Growing Research is a company name I chose for hosting my projects. It was formerly my limited company when I worked in land-based research and proposal development, but as I have been developing my skills in health data science, the name has taken on a newer meaning. -->

Hello! I am Chantel, and I am a data scientist with research interests spanning health (particularly mental health), justice and equality, spatial data/ GIS, and ecology and biodiversity. When I am not building data projects, I create nature-friendly gardens, grow food with my local community, and enjoy mountain-biking and weight-lifting with my husband and primary cheerleader. See his website here: [www.garvinsealy.com](https://www.garvinsealy.com).

I am going through a career transition into health data science, and currently looking for employment or collaborative opportunities. If you like what you see and might like to work with me, please contact me.

For a snapshot of my training and experience, see [CV](cv.qmd).

## Programming and scripting languages

I love programming and coding, and delve into different languages as needed depending on the project. I use a LAMP (Linux-Apache2-MySQL-PHP) stack for local development.

- R/ RStudio - statistical programming, quantitative work, dashboards and storyboards
- SQL (MS Access, Oracle, MySQL, SQLite)
- phpMyAdmin (for MySQL queries and managing Wordpress)
- Python (to PCEP) - text extraction and qualitative work
- Bash (I am a long-time Linux-user) - system administration
- HTML5
- CSS3
- A little bit of Javascript for the extra flourish
